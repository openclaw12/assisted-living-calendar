# UX Guidelines

- Prioritize legibility: minimum 16px body text, high contrast palettes, toggleable font scaling.
- Touch-friendly controls for kiosks/tablets; avoid small hit targets.
- Provide voice narration / audio prompts for residents with low vision (future enhancement).
- Offer quick context in panels (who's attending, transportation plan, dietary notes).
- Staff dashboard surfaces alerts first: coverage gaps, pending approvals, safety incidents.
